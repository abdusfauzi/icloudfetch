# Download iCloud Photos and Videos

This script is very juvenile and at its infancy stage. I am not responsible for any damage done due to the use of this script. Do you own research.

Steps:

1. Run `python3 -m venv venv` before start running the script. Prepare a python environment.
2. Load into the virtual python environment by running `source venv/bin/activate`.
3. Run the script using `python icloud_downloader.py`.
